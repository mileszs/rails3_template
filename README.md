# My Rails 3 Application Template
 **FANCY**

    rails new appname -d postgresql -m /path/to/template.rb

## What it do:
+ Populates the Gemfile with a ton of shit
+ Creates an .rvmrc
+ Generates Compass stuffs with HTML5 Boilerplate stuffs
+ Sets up Simple Form
+ Sets up Cucumber
+ Sets up Barista
+ Throws in a couple helpers (for title and meta description)
+ Sets up RSpec
+ Replaces Prototype with jQuery
+ git init . and commit all that shit.

## TODO
+ 960.gs instead of blueprint?

## Thank you.

Mike Fischer's [Rails app template](http://thelastpixel.net/2010/11/21/rails-3-application-template/) was a huge help. I copied much of this template from his. I also used Jeremy McAnally's [rails-templates](https://github.com/jm/rails-templates) repo for some inspiration.
